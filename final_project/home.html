                <p>
                    This is just a small tribute site to my wonderful Partner, Fern. Though I am doing this for a class project, the primary reason for this site is to just be a little thing I make for him. (He has no idea I'm doing this by the way, so when you read this Fern, Surprise! :]) I’ve really enjoyed making websites in this class and honestly this was one of the first things that popped into my mind when I was thinking what websites I wanted to make, and it’s been a running joke for a while- but joke no further! Without further a due—this is::

                    In the navigation tab at the top of this page ↑ As well as the column links at the bottom of the page ↓  you will find links to pages- The Beginning, Him. Me. US. (pretty self-explanatory). This place you're in now- it is nothing, and it is everything. It is before, and it is after- it is retrospect and introspect. This place is simply the home. This is the comfortable silence- the silence before the bang. The rest of that's on the other pages ˘͈ᵕ˘͈

                <h2> What to expect:</h2>

                <p>
                    Below are the mentioned links at the bottom of the page that will lead you to the following pages of this site. Here’s a little bit of what to expect: The Beginning- will talk a bit about the very beginning- how we met, how we got to know each other- the beginning of the relationship, all that fun stuff :]  -- Him. A page specifically dedicated to him- though this whole site technically is, this is specifically his page :] -- Me. This page is about me- kind of- because with this being a site dedicated to him it’s about me in relation to him, but still me :] -- and finally, US. This page is about Us- where we are, where we’re hopefully going, and just- I don’t know man—us ♥

                        In the beginning, there was no Us. There was only me, and him- separate lives, separate states- separate hearts. Until one late night, one stary text, and in retrospect, one very good decision to stay up a bit later.

                        I don't even know if I can summarize or begin to describe who he is. I feel like every part of me knows him, yet he's still an anigma. There is no summary fitting to who you are as a person, other than you are my Sun, my Stars, and my Knight.
