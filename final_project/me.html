            <h2> A little more about me I guess</h2>
            <p>
                I met Fern a little while after I graduated high school. I was just starting to kind of stretch back into the dating scene after taking a break for about 3 years. I was on a few different apps and wasn't really thinking I'd find anything, and at the time wasn't really looking to find anything- just letting things come my way. I've been pretty hurt in the past by former partners and other relationships and for a while, coming into this relationship, I was skeptical. But that's just another thing that he tends to help me with. I've grown a lot as a person since the beginning of our relationship and I feel like I'm a lot healthier than I was then. Every day I continue to grow as a person with his help. I'm in my first year here at Chatt State and he's in his second year at his college, which is a four-year. It's a little rough, but, It works, and we'll probably end up graduating at around the same time. I have a lot of hope for the future, especially now that I'm with him. I haven't always been the most hopeful person, but I've gotten more optimistic. Even now, as I'm doing this project, he's cheering me on, not even knowing what he's cheering for. Which I don't perceive as blindly following me, but more as unconditional support. Something I've needed. 
            </p>
            <h3>This is me :]</h3>

                Umm, I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to say about myself. I'm not very good at talking about myself a lot of the time. My favorite color is also that kind of muted, earthy green and also slate Gray. My favorite food is also fruit, which is great because I like Cantaloupe and Fern likes Honeydew so- We can just switch those out. My favorite music artists are LoveJoy, Nirvana, and a bunch of other really obscure artists, recently though, I've been into more Soft indie folk music. I also love art. It’s a passion. It's also what I choose to pursue with my career, except not in the same way that he does. I plan to be a tattoo artist, making my art have a mark on people in a different way. You have already guessed throughout this website I'm also a bit of a poet too. I tend to be a little bit poetic, especially when I talk about things like this. Oh, actually, can I show you a poem I've written?

            <h3> Just Hold On.</h3>
            <p>
                Just hold on 
                Because the foundation is steady 
                There’s just a few cracks in the floors 
                A few holes in the drywall 
                A little water damage around the tub 
                But just hold on 
                It’s not enough to sink through 
                Our house is not haunted 
                It’s just not perfect 
                It’s not broken 
                It just needs work 
                It’s got leaky faucets, and drafty windows 
                With a few peeling spots of paint 
                It’s not condemned-
                The last people to live here just didn’t take very good care of it. 
                It’s every renovators wet dream- 
                And we 
                We are artists.
                We are architects trained in the art of learning from our mistakes 
                Every word a new stroke of paint 
                Sending 
                Bending us to a product we cannot see
                But are sure we will create 
                And when the cracks seem too big- 
                We will pour from our hearts 
                A concrete mix of sureness and “I’ll be there” 
                We won’t run 
                Because the cost of materials is never too high when it comes to love 
                Just hold on, 
                because renovation takes time 
                And we won’t always get things right the first try 
                But passion projects mean rolling with the punches 
                It means taking our time 
                And yes, nothing is perfect 
                But just hold on 
                We can make this house shine

                That was when I did a little while ago. Can you guess what it's about? I love doing art in almost any form. I'm honestly just kind of a silly, goofy little guy. That's. Just trudging through life. Doing what I have to do, and if I'm lucky, doing things that make me feel good while I do it. Of course, I don't think I'd be where I am now if I didn't have Fern. He's made the last year bearable. More than bearable, he's made it livable- More than that, he's made it enjoyable. It's an honor to dedicate this site to him. But enough about me, this isn't my site after all. Well- I mean- technically it is, but you get what I mean.

                    In the beginning, there was no Us. There was only me, and him- separate lives, separate states- separate hearts. Until one late night, one stary text, and in retrospect, one very good decision to stay up a bit later.

                    I don't even know if I can summarize or begin to describe who he is. I feel like every part of me knows him, yet he's still an anigma. There is no summary fitting to who you are as a person, other than you are my Sun, my Stars, and my Knight.
