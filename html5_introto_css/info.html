            <h3>A little more about JRWI</h3>
            <p>
                Just Roll With It is a D&D podcast run by 4 content creators- Charlie slimecicle, Grizzly Plays, Bizzly, and Condifiction. Started in 2022
                this enthrawling D&D podcast has emmased major popularity. Though the main campaign is Riptide, with Grizzly being the DM, the podcast does have 
                other campaigns that they air hosted by all different participants in the show. Currently as of the creation of this site, the Riptide campaign 
                is on a 6 month hiatus for unknown reasons, though they are uploading from other campaigns. All 4 participants also create solo content that they 
                uplaod regularly if you just can't get enough of your favorite goofballs. Personally I've been listening to JRWI for almost 2 years, and they got me into D&D if that 
                speaks anything to how good this podcast is. Seriously- if you don't know anything about it and you're into D&D, check it out.
