            <p>
            Our journey begins as any good stories do- in the midde of nowhere in the ocean. Navice pirates Chip and Jay find one Gillion Tidestrider floating 
            atop the waves and pull him aboard, thus banding the Riptide Pirates. Our trio of confused pirates find themselves navigating tough waters and even
            tougher calls, entertwining their fates with the mysterious, master of desire, Niklaus Hendrix. From humble beginings our pirates journey further 
            digging up treasure, new crewmates, and secrets that thrust them futher down an unknown path. With the weight of every sad town they help, every navy base they raid and capture they evade- with every mystery
            they unveil our heros fall futher and futher down a dark hole. Dispite the odds our three heros, from completley different worlds, colide to save eacother and the world as a whole. 
            But of course, every good hero has some baggage, how else would you keep it interesting?

         <h2>Chip</h2>
         <img src="images/chippy.png" alt="Chip character design">
         <p>
            Chip "Bastard" Rose(?), one of the three captains of the Riptide pirates and the original Riptide Pirate. With little memory of his past,
            Chip in a bit of an enigma, but a skilled pirate. Being raised on a pirate ship for a good part of his childhood- and not just any any pirate ship-
            the Black Rose Pirates, some of the best of the best- will do that. Chip was taken for the Black Rose at a young age by the Hole in the sea, that took 
            his captain, most of his crewmates, and his best friend. Now, hell-bent on living up to the memory of his mentor and saving his hold crew, Chip is haunted
            by the fate handed down to him from the Black Rose. Chip lived here and there for most of his life after the Black Rose, getting into all kinds of things 
            to stay alive, many of which things have contributed to his lack of memory. After meeting Jay, Chip banded together the Riptide Pirates to begin his 
            quest to be the best pirate he could, and to find his lost friends. Through his Journey chip changes quite a bit- most for the better- and finds that there 
            and new friends to go on for.

         <h2>Gillion</h2>
         <img src="images/Gilly.jpg" alt="Gillion character design">
         <p>
            Gillion "Destiny" Tidestrider, the digraced prophecy chid of the undersea. Gillion spent most of his life away form almost everyone including his family 
            being trained as the prophesied champion of the Undersea, a title thrust upon him since birth. With his head being filled with delusions of grandeur
            and his days occupied with nonstop training, Gillion did become the undersea's greates warrior- but not the smartest. After years of training and 
            preperation, Gillion made the mistake of speaking out of turn to forign general visiting the Undersea. Or- rather I should say, Gillion made the mistake
            of attacking the visiting general, causing him to be banished from the Undersea for his crime and puting the Undersea at risk. It was after this that Gillion
            was found floating atop the ocean by his soon to be crewmates Chip and Jay. Struggling with figuring out who his is, who hes ment to be, and who hes been trained to be 
            Gillion carves his own path with the Riptide pirates in a quest to figure out what he's fighting for.

         <h2>Jay</h2>
         <img src="images/Jay_doa.jpg" alt="Jay with a wanted poster">
         <p>
            Jay Ferrin "the navigator", Daughter of Navy General Jayson Ferrin, and run away from the Navy. Jay was the second to join the Riptide pirates
            after Chip picked her up from the island she was bound to with her mother. With asperations for adventure and a yearn for the open sea (accompanied 
            by some possible spy work) Jay achieved becoming a pirate dispite her stricks non-pirate Navy upbringing. Being an extrodinary builder and the Daughter of an 
            extremley powerful family, its no wonder Jay finds herslef as on of the Riptide captains. Though her loyalties may have been questionable, Jay 
            found purpose and drive on the sea she didn't think she'd find. And not only that, she found a family. By seeing what the Navy had done to the world 
            and learning that she could do more good, Jay gained a new drive to take down her Father and the Navy, leaving no questions as to where her loyaties lie. 
            Jay is the center of intel on the ship most of the time, as well as usually being the only one that has any sense.
